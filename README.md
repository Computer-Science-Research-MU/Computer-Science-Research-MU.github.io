# Computer Science Research at MU
Computer Science Research in Maynooth University (Ireland)

This repo is a website under development that is hosted at <a href="https://research.cs.nuim.ie" target="_blank">https://research.cs.nuim.ie</a>.
It has the purpose of  providing additional up-to-date information about our research activities, complementing the official Maynooth Computer Science departmental webpage <a href="https://www.maynoothuniversity.ie/computer-science" target="_blank">https://www.maynoothuniversity.ie/computer-science</a>. 

## Information for MU CS staff

Current administrators of this Github account are:
- [Barak Pearlmutter](https://www.maynoothuniversity.ie/faculty-science-engineering/our-people/barak-pearlmutter)
- [Rozenn Dahyot](https://www.maynoothuniversity.ie/faculty-science-engineering/our-people/rozenn-dahyot) is currently managing the content of the  html pages in this repo. Note these html pages are the result of a compilation (with R) i.e.
-  ```MUCSprojects.html``` and ```MUCSworks.html``` are  timelines created  with R.  
- ```index.old.2024.html``` was generated with R and both **names and keywords information  about academic staff interests** was taken automatically from staff Google Scholar page. This has been replaced with a simple ```index.md``` page.
  

### **Updating the timeline** ```MUCSprojects.html```
