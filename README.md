# Computer Science Research at MU
Computer Science Research in Maynooth University (Ireland)

This repo is a website under development that is hosted at <a href="https://research.cs.nuim.ie" target="_blank">https://research.cs.nuim.ie</a>.
It has the purpose of  providing additional up-to-date information about our research activities, complementing the official Maynooth Computer Science departmental webpage <a href="https://www.maynoothuniversity.ie/computer-science" target="_blank">https://www.maynoothuniversity.ie/computer-science</a>. 

## Administrators

Current administrators of this Github account are:
- [Barack Pearlmutter](https://www.maynoothuniversity.ie/faculty-science-engineering/our-people/barak-pearlmutter)
- [Rozenn Dahyot](https://www.maynoothuniversity.ie/faculty-science-engineering/our-people/rozenn-dahyot) is managing the content of the  html pages in this repo. Note these html pages are the result of a compilation (with R) i.e.
  - **Names and keywords information  about academic staff interests** in ```index.html``` is **taken automatically from their Google Scholar page**
  - timeline ```MUCSprojects.html``` is created  with information stored and updated in an xlsx file.


## Updating the timeline for MU CS projects

For CS MU staff, to have your (past, current, upcoming) project added to the <a href="https://research.cs.nuim.ie/MUCSprojects.html" target="_blank">project Timeline</a>, please email <a href="https://www.maynoothuniversity.ie/faculty-science-engineering/our-people/rozenn-dahyot" target="_blank">Rozenn Dahyot</a> with the following information about your project:
- funding agency and call programme (e.g. EU, SFI , EPA, EI, IRC, Start-up, etc.)
- the acronym and the title of the project
- the start date of the project  (e.g. 01/01/1970)
- the end date of the project  (e.g. 01/10/2023)
- the names MU CS academic staff involved in that project (these names appear when overing on the box of the project with the mouse)
- the url to that project page that provides more information (e.g. abstract,  students/staff working on that project, etc.)

## Updating the timeline for other MU CS academic contributions to CS discipline

A new timeline ```MUCSworks.html``` is under construction and visible [here](https://research.cs.nuim.ie/MUCSworks.html). It aims at capturing some other (time consuming!) research related activities that MU CS academics contribute to such as conference organisation, reviewer, editor, etc. 

For CS MU staff, to have an (past, current, upcoming) activity or event added, please email <a href="https://www.maynoothuniversity.ie/faculty-science-engineering/our-people/rozenn-dahyot" target="_blank">Rozenn Dahyot</a> with the following information:
- name of event/activity
- your role in that event/activity
- start date and end date
- url of that event
