# Computer Science Research at MU

## Computer Vision Group

The Computer Vision Group was formed in 2001 within the Department of Computer Science at Maynooth University. With strengths in computer vision, image processing, machine learning, and robotics, over the years the group has been involved in projects in areas including facial expression analysis, intelligent vehicle systems, digital holographic image processing, and automatic sign language recognition. Since 2007 research within the lab has consolidated to focus on vision based advanced geotechnologies, developing new techniques for augmented reality, building facade extraction, visual place recognition, mobile mapping systems, visual simultaneous localisation and mapping, and dense mapping and reconstruction using RGBD sensors.

## Naturally Inspired Computation Research Group

Our group tackles complex challenging problems inspired by nature including biological systems and their social and physical behaviours.

## TAPDANCE: Theory And Practice of DNA Computing Engines

Our research group carries out fundamental research on molecular computers: collections molecules in a test tube that compute by bumping into each other and executing logical statements. Our focus is on both the underlying computational theory and practical implementation in the lab. Our team is multidisciplinary, we prove theorems about models of computation, we make designs using software/whiteboards, and we implement our designs in the wet-lab using artificially-synthesised DNA molecules!

We are often looking to hire undergrads for 4-6 month research projects, as well as PhD students and, from time-to-time, postdocs and technicians.
